the	B-LOC

I	B-PER

it	O

the	O

I	B-PER
can	O

So	O

there	O
are	O

Hollywood	B-ORG-PER

starlets	I-PER
there	I-GPE

there	O
is	O
not	O
a	O

Just	O
the	O
howling	O

and	O
the	O

otherwise	O

And	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
fog	O
I	B-PER
guess	O
now	O

Apparently	O
,	O
it	O
's	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
hard	O
to	O
get	O
a	O

Apparently	O
so	O
,	O
yes	O

and	O
the	B-PER

A	O

Well	O

when	O
this	O

happens	O
in	O
a	B-GPE
small	I-GPE

and	O
I	B-PER

that	O
's	O
a	O
under	O
statement	O
in	O
this	O

,	O
whether	O
or	O
not	O
it	O
all	O
succeeds	O
depends	O
on	O
how	O
well	O
some	B-PER

the	I-PER-PER
local	I-PER-PER

can	O

Are	O
people	B-PER
kind	O
of	O
,	O
you	B-PER
know	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
fold	O
on	O
this	O

or	O
are	O

there	O
?	O

Well	O
Skibo	B-FAC
Castlee	I-FAC
,	I-FAC
where	I-FAC-FAC
the	I-FAC
wedding	I-FAC
is	I-FAC
being	I-FAC
held	I-FAC
,	O
is	O
very	O
discrete	O
.	O

There	O
have	O
been	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
celebrity	B-PER
weddings	O
there	B-FAC
but	O
none	O
as	O
big	O
as	O
this	O
admittedly	O
.	O


Reportedly	O
,	O
it	B-PER
was	O
Elton	B-PER
John	I-PER
who	I-PER-PER
was	I-PER
going	I-PER
to	I-PER
play	I-PER
a	I-PER
song	I-PER
for	I-PER
Guy	I-PER-PER
and	O
the	B-FAC
shop	I-FAC
was	O
inundated	O
when	O
this	O
was	O
leaked	O
and	O
people	B-PER
just	O
wanting	O
to	O
touch	O
the	O
piano	O
that	O
was	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
in	O
the	B-FAC
same	I-FAC
room	I-FAC
as	I-FAC
Madonna	I-FAC-PER
and	I-FAC
Guy	I-FAC-PER
Ritchie	I-FAC-PER
.	O

I	B-PER
imagine	O
the	O
locals	O
could	O
be	O
kind	O
of	O
swooning	O
for	O
quite	O
a	O
while	O
because	O
Sting	B-PER
,	I-PER
who	I-PER-PER
I	I-PER-PER
guess	I-PER
might	I-PER
be	I-PER
singing	I-PER
at	I-PER
the	I-PER
wedding	I-PER
,	O
his	B-PER-PER
wife	I-PER
introduced	O
the	B-PER
couple	I-PER
,	O
Brad	B-PER
Pitt	I-PER
,	O
Gwyneth	B-PER
Paltrow	I-PER
,	O
Robin	B-PER
Williams	I-PER
,	O
George	B-PER
Clooney	I-PER
,	O
any	B-PER
other	I-PER
people	I-PER
around	I-PER
there	I-PER-GPE
are	O
specially	O
fond	O
of	O
?	O

Well	O
,	O
I	B-PER
think	O
that	O
is	O
the	O
most	O
unusual	O
thing	O
about	O
it	O
.	O

I	B-PER
mean	O
I	B-PER
have	O
some	B-PER
friends	I-PER
who	I-PER-PER
live	I-PER
up	I-PER
in	I-PER
there	I-PER-GPE
next	I-PER
to	I-PER
the	I-PER-LOC
woods	I-PER-LOC
and	O
people	B-PER
are	O
just	O
surprised	O
that	O
they	B-PER
would	O
choose	O
this	B-GPE
little	I-GPE
tiny	I-GPE
village	I-GPE
in	I-GPE
Scotland	I-GPE-GPE
.	O

It	O
is	O
the	O
juxtaposition	O
of	O
that	O
glamour	O
,	O
I	B-PER
mean	O
a	B-PER
Gwyneth	I-PER
Paltrow	I-PER
in	I-PER
Inverness	I-PER-GPE
,	O
it	O
just	O
does	O
n't	O
sound	O
what	O
they	B-PER
are	O
thinking	O
about	O
.	O

And	O
,	O
of	O
course	O
,	O
Stella	B-PER
McCartney	I-PER
is	O
there	B-GPE
too	O
and	O
apparently	O
Celine	B-PER
Dion	I-PER
.	O


So	O
this	O
must	O
be	O
a	O
real	O
boom	O
to	O
the	O
local	O
economy	O
?	O

Oh	O
absolutely	O
,	O
I	B-PER
mean	O
it	O
's	O
been	O
estimated	O
that	O
3	O
million	O
pounds	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
about	O
5	O
million	O
dollars	O
,	O
will	O
be	O
made	O
over	O
the	O
next	O
few	O
weeks	O
in	O
Dornoch	B-GPE
just	O
from	O
journalists	B-PER
and	O
celebrities	B-PER
and	O
sort	O
of	O
sightseers	B-PER
I	I-PER
guess	O
coming	O
to	O
see	O
where	B-GPE
Madonna	I-GPE-PER
got	I-GPE
married	I-GPE
.	O

Gosh	O
,	O
this	O
must	O
be	O
you	B-PER
know	O
about	O
five	O
thousand	O
times	O
the	O
local	O
budget	O
there	B-GPE
.	O

Yeah	O
,	O
absolutely	O
.	O

I	B-PER
do	O
n't	O
think	O
they	B-GPE
'll	O
know	O
what	O
to	O
do	O
with	O
all	O
that	O
money	O
out	O
there	B-GPE

There	O
is	O
only	O
so	O
many	O

also	O
planning	O
on	O

in	O

they	B-ORG
're	O
estimating	O
some	O
60	O
million	O
dollars	O
will	O
be	O
made	O
over	O
the	O
next	O
few	O
years	O
,	O
just	O
with	O
people	B-PER

,	O
does	O
it	O
appear	O
somewhat	O
ironic	O
that	O
they	B-PER
are	O
going	O
to	O
the	B-ORG
Supreme	I-ORG
Court	I-ORG
in	O
this	O
instance	O
?	O

No	O
,	O
I	B-PER
think	O
first	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
notion	O
that	O
Republicans	B-PER
favor	O
states	B-GPE
'	O
rights	O
and	O
Democrats	B-PER
oppose	O
it	O
,	O
is	O
much	O
too	O
simplistic	O
.	O

That	O
's	O
generally	O
true	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
's	O
only	O
true	O
on	O
some	O
issues	O
.	O

And	O
in	O
this	O
case	O
,	O
you	B-PER
could	O
argue	O
that	O
the	B-ORG
Bush	I-ORG-PER
people	I-ORG
are	O
going	O
to	O
the	B-ORG
Supreme	I-ORG
Court	I-ORG
to	O
preserve	O
the	O
right	O
of	O
Florida	B-GPE
,	O
to	O
determine	O
its	B-GPE-PER
own	I-PER
electors	I-PER
.	O

So	O
,	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
states	B-GPE
'	O
rights	O
issue	O
there	O
.	O

But	O
they	B-ORG
need	O
,	O
or	O
at	O
least	O
they	B-ORG
once	O
thought	O
they	B-ORG
needed	O
the	B-ORG
Supreme	I-ORG
Court	I-ORG
to	O
endorse	O
it	O
.	O

So	O
it	O
goes	O
both	O
ways	O
.	O

What	O
are	O
the	B-PER
justices	I-PER
likely	O
looking	O
for	O
?	O

Well	O
,	O
I	B-PER
do	O
n't	O
know	O
.	O

But	O
I	B-PER
think	O
that	O
-	O
and	O
I	B-PER
think	O
they	B-PER
will	O
be	O
divided	O
,	O
I	B-PER
mean	O
I	B-PER
do	O
n't	O
think	O
they	B-PER
will	O
be	O
unanimous	O
.	O

Obviously	O
,	O
they	B-PER
would	O
like	O
to	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
achieve	O
some	O
kind	O
of	O
resolution	O
of	O
the	O
case	O
.	O

American	B-GPE
election	O
laws	O
are	O
often	O
challenged	O
at	O
the	O
local	O
level	O
and	O
sometimes	O
in	O
the	B-ORG
Federal	I-ORG
courts	I-ORG
,	O
but	O
this	O
is	O
certainly	O
the	O
first	O
time	O
we	B-GPE
have	O
had	O
a	O
Supreme	B-ORG
Court	I-ORG
challenge	O
over	O
presidential	O
election	O
.	O

So	O
,	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
new	O
law	O
here	O
to	O
be	O
made	O
or	O
at	O

law	O
that	O

at	O

as	O
it	O
is	O
expressed	O
in	O

they	B-ORG

that	O

a	O

once	O

then	O
the	O

But	O
in	O

there	O
we	B-PER

to	O
have	O
confidence	O
that	O

The	B-PER
Egyptian	I-PER-GPE
President	I-PER
Hosni	I-PER
Mubarak	I-PER
is	O
more	O
of	O
a	O
voice	O
of	O
moderation	O
against	O
the	B-GPE
other	I-GPE
side	I-GPE
.	O

Tell	O
us	B-PER
about	O
what	O
he	B-PER
has	O
been	O
saying	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
Mr.	B-PER-PER
Mubarak	I-PER
has	O
been	O
,	O
as	O
you	B-PER
say	O
,	O
a	B-PER
voice	I-PER
of	I-PER
moderation	I-PER
.	O

He	B-PER
has	O
invested	O
an	O
awful	O
amount	O
in	O
the	O
peace	O
with	O
Israel	B-GPE
,	O
and	O
really	O
he	B-PER
can	O
not	O
afford	O
to	O
let	O
it	O
fail	O
.	O


So	O
Egypt	B-GPE
is	O
playing	O
a	O
calming	O
role	O
,	O
it	B-GPE
will	O
not	O
want	O
to	O
see	O
anything	O
too	O
strong	O
coming	O
out	O
of	O
this	O
summit	O
due	O
to	O
end	O
on	O
Sunday	O
.	O

What	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
prevailing	O
voices	O
at	O
this	O
point	O
?	O

There	O
are	O
certainly	O
calls	O
for	O
war	O
against	O
Israel	B-GPE
.	O

Is	O
there	O
much	O
support	O
for	O
that	O
?	O

Well	O
,	O
actually	O
President	B-PER-PER
Mubarak	I-PER
was	O
very	O
categorical	O
today	O
in	O
condemning	O
calls	O
for	O
war	O
,	O
which	O
he	B-PER
said	O
were	O
very	O
serious	O
and	O
people	B-PER
should	O
understand	O
the	O
implications	O
of	O
just	O
what	O
it	O
meant	O
.	O

Egypt	B-GPE
and	O
Jordan	B-GPE
do	O
not	O
want	O
to	O
see	O
any	O
sort	O
of	O
conventional	O
war	O
against	O
Israel	B-GPE
.	O

They	B-GPE
have	O
both	O
invested	O
enormous	O
amounts	O
in	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
both	B-GPE
regimes	I-GPE
would	O
be	O
more	O
vulnerable	O
if	O
the	O
peace	O
process	O
were	O
to	O
fail	O
,	O
because	O
detractors	B-PER
and	I-PER
opponents	I-PER
within	I-PER
each	I-PER-GPE
country	I-PER-GPE
would	O
have	O
ammunition	O
by	O
which	O
to	O
fire	O
at	O
them	B-GPE
.	O

How	O
much	O
is	O
the	B-GPE
United	I-GPE
States	I-GPE
entering	O
into	O
the	O
conversation	O
and	O
how	O
much	O
pressure	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
coming	O
from	O
the	B-GPE
United	I-GPE
States	I-GPE
?	O

Well	O
today	O
not	O
too	O
much	O
.	O

I	B-PER
mean	O
Madeleine	B-PER
Albright	I-PER
was	O
in	O
Saudi	B-GPE
Arabia	I-GPE
yesterday	O
where	B-GPE
she	I-PER
met	O
with	O
crown	B-PER-PER
prince	I-PER-PER
Abdullah	I-PER
and	O
the	B-PER
new	I-PER
Syrian	I-PER-GPE
president	I-PER
Bashar	I-PER
Al	I-PER
Assad	I-PER
.	O

Interestingly	O
enough	O
she	B-PER
is	O
quoted	O
as	O
telling	O
General	B-PER-PER
Sanholi	I-PER
back	O
to	O
the	B-GPE
US	I-GPE
that	O
she	B-PER
did	O
not	O
really	O
get	O
too	O
much	O
of	O
a	O
reception	O
from	O
Bashar	B-PER
Al	I-PER
Assad	I-PER
in	O
terms	O
of	O
lightening	O
the	O
traditionally	O
antagonistic	O
Syrian	B-GPE
align	O
towards	O
Israel	B-GPE
.	O

Nonetheless	O
,	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
she	B-PER
did	O
meet	O
with	O
Bashar	B-PER
Al	I-PER
Assad	I-PER
and	O
it	O
was	O
n't	O
Saudi	B-GPE
Arabia	I-GPE
which	O
is	O
traditionally	O
being	O
more	O
dovish	O
and	O
has	O
supported	O
US	B-GPE
policy	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
significant	O
.	O

So	O
,	O
as	O
of	O
today	O
,	O
I	B-PER
would	O
say	O
certainly	O
on	O
the	O
surface	O
there	O
has	O
been	O
little	O
US	B-GPE

how	O

this	B-PER
fellow	I-PER
plan	O
to	O
profit	O
from	O
the	O
sheep	O
of	O
the	B-LOC
Abruzzo	I-LOC
?	O

He	B-PER
is	O
taking	O
advantage	O
of	O
two	O
craze	O
that	O
we	B-GPE
are	O
having	O
in	O
the	B-GPE
Italy	I-GPE
at	O
the	O
moment	O

one	O
is	O
Internet	O
,	O
the	O
other	O
one	O
is	O
the	O
awareness	O
on	O
food	O
.	O

So	O
this	B-PER
guy	I-PER
came	O
up	O
with	O
the	O
idea	O
of	O
having	O
people	B-PER
adopting	O
sheep	O
by	O
an	O
Internet	O
.	O

So	O
you	B-PER
can	O
have	O
access	O
through	O
your	B-PER
computer	O
on	O
your	B-PER
desk	O
.	O

Go	O
to	O
the	O
web	O
site	O
of	O
these	B-PER
guys	I-PER
and	O
you	B-PER
can	O
have	O
look	O
at	O
the	O
face	O
of	O
sheep	O
which	O
are	O
available	O
to	O
be	O
adopted	O
.	O

So	O
what	O
does	O
it	O
mean	O
to	O
adopt	O
a	O
sheep	O
,	O
to	O
show	O
up	O
on	O
your	B-PER
back	O
step	O
or	O
do	O
you	B-PER
,	O
somehow	O
keep	O
track	O
of	O
it	O
's	O
progress	O
on	O
the	B-FAC
farm	I-FAC
in	I-FAC
Italy	I-FAC-GPE
?	O

You	B-PER
are	O
not	O
actually	O
adopting	O
the	O
sheep	O
in	O
the	O
sense	O
that	O
you	B-PER
can	O
have	O
it	O
with	O
you	B-PER
.	O

It	O
looks	O
like	O
distant	O
adoption	O
,	O
where	O
you	B-PER
do	O
n't	O
actually	O
have	O
the	B-PER
child	I-PER
in	O
your	B-PER-FAC
home	I-FAC
,	O
you	B-PER
are	O
just	O
contributing	O
with	O
a	O
certain	O
amount	O
of	O
money	O
and	O
your	B-PER
are	O
monitoring	O
the	O
growing	O
up	O
.	O


All	O
right	O
,	O
so	O
the	O
amount	O
of	O
money	O
you	B-PER
have	O
mentioned	O
to	O
us	B-PER
is	O
about	O
160	O
US	O
dollars	O
and	O
for	O
that	O
you	B-PER
get	O
more	O
than	O
just	O
a	O
one	O
warm	O
and	O
fuzzy	O
feeling	O
.	O

You	B-PER
can	O
also	O
receive	O
leggings	O
that	O
are	O
made	O
from	O
wool	O
of	O
the	O
sheep	O
and	O
even	O
if	O
you	B-PER
like	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
sheep	O
dropping	O
delivered	O
to	O
your	B-PER
door	O
.	O

Yeah	O
,	O
I	B-PER
mean	O
this	O
is	O
quite	O
funny	O
.	O

But	O
I	B-PER
think	O
apart	O
from	O
all	O
the	O
details	O
,	O
which	O
are	O
sometimes	O
even	O
strange	O
I	B-PER
think	O
what	O
is	O
really	O
important	O
is	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
sign	O
of	O
a	O
new	O
concern	O
that	O
is	O
effecting	O
Italian	B-GPE-GPE
people	I-GPE
.	O

I	B-PER
mean	O
we	B-GPE
are	O
notoriously	O
lover	O
of	O
good	O
food	O
.	O

We	B-GPE
have	O
a	O
generous	O
attitude	O
towards	O
food	O
.	O

And	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
new	O
stuff	O
.	O

The	O
fact	O
that	O
you	B-PER
really	O
care	O
about	O
a	O
sheep	O
in	O
the	O
way	O
she	O
is	O
feed	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
way	O
she	O
is	O
nurtured	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
way	O
people	B-PER
are	O
looking	O
after	O
it	O
,	O
because	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
way	O
to	O
ensure	O
that	O
you	B-PER
have	O
something	O
which	O
is	O
genuine	O
on	O
your	B-PER
table	O
up	O
the	O
end	O
.	O

Wait	O
a	O
minute	O
,	O
you	B-PER
said	O
that	O
on	O
your	B-PER
table	O
up	O
the	O
end	O

Yeah	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
table	O
if	O
it	O
becomes	O
food	O
for	O
instance	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
an	O
option	O

You	B-PER
are	O

the	O

and	O
whatever	O
happens	O
at	O
the	O

it	O

your	B-PER

among	O
the	O

That	O
kind	O
of	O
puts	O
a	O
whole	O
new	O
tone	O
to	O
this	O
thing	O
.	O

I	B-PER
mean	O
usually	O
when	O
you	B-PER
think	O
of	O
this	O
kind	O
of	O
adoption	O
that	O
means	O
saving	O

Normally	O
I	B-PER
would	O
n't	O
interfere	O

at	O

not	O
since	O
Hillary	B-PER

asked	O
whether	O
she	B-PER
should	O
stand	O
in	O
New	B-GPE

I	B-PER
advised	O
her	B-PER
there	O
was	O
more	O
chance	O
of	O
Rudy	B-PER

caught	O

all	O

what	O
about	O
allowing	O

he	B-PER

Another	O
way	O
of	O
deciding	O
who	B-PER
should	O
be	O
your	B-GPE-PER

is	O
by	O

If	O

does	O
it	O

I	B-PER

you	B-PER

it	O
at	O

why	O

the	B-PER
