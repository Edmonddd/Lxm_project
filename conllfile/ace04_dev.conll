of	O

the	B-ORG

,	O
was	O
that	O
those	B-PER

above	O
politics	O
and	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
also	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
bad	O
surprises	O
that	O
this	O

is	O
reserving	O
to	O
us	B-GPE-GPE
Europeans	I-GPE
is	O
that	O
finally	O
your	B-GPE-ORG
system	I-ORG
is	O
not	O
as	O
perfect	O
as	O
we	B-GPE
were	O
led	O
to	O
believe	O

I	B-PER
wonder	O
in	O

of	O
this	O

now	O
this	O
is	O

an	O
extreme	O
case	O
in	O
the	B-GPE

one	O
of	O

,	O
you	O

our	B-GPE

What	O
happens	O
to	O
yours	B-GPE
?	O

Well	O
,	O
there	O
have	O
been	O
cases	O
in	O
most	O
recent	O
elections	O
in	O
France	B-GPE
where	O
the	B-ORG
Coseque	I-ORG
constitutionalle	I-ORG
having	O
been	O
apprised	O
of	O
doubtful	O

to	O

fact	O
change	O
the	B-PER

.	O

However	O
,	O
our	O
electoral	O
system	O
is	O
so	O
much	O
more	O
simple	O
in	O
the	O
sense	O
that	O
we	O
have	O

for	O
the	B-ORG

,	O
for	O
Parliament	B-ORG
,	O
for	O
our	B-GPE-PER
Mayors	I-PER
and	O
therefore	O
usually	O
most	B-PER
French	I-PER-GPE
voters	I-PER
are	O
faced	O
with	O
the	O
difficulty	O
of	O
choosing	O
a	O
little	O
paper	O
ballotenne	O
with	O
a	O
name	O
on	O
it	O
and	O
putting	O
that	O

an	O
envelop	O
and	O
then	O
put	O
that	O
in	O
the	O

so	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
much	O
less	O
chance	O

at	O

in	O

Hey	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
interesting	O
there	O
also	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
look	O
at	O
the	O
idea	O
of	O

,	O
in	O
terms	O
of	O
the	O

,	O
that	O
actually	O
originated	O
in	O
France	B-GPE
.	O

Yes	O
indeed	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
political	O
idea	O
put	O
forward	O
in	O
the	O
writings	O
of	O
the	O
and	O
another	B-PER
very	I-PER
famous	I-PER

who	I-PER

an	O
amazingly	O
good	O

about	O
American	B-GPE

exactly	O
that	O

that	O

seemed	O
to	O
him	O
to	O
be	O
the	B-GPE
single	I-GPE
country	I-GPE
in	I-GPE
the	I-GPE-LOC
world	I-GPE-LOC
who	I-GPE-GPE
has	I-GPE
managed	I-GPE
to	I-GPE
apply	I-GPE
the	I-GPE
separation	I-GPE
of	I-GPE
powers	I-GPE
between	I-GPE
the	I-GPE

it	O
's	O
quite	O
surprising	O
for	O
us	B-GPE-GPE

to	O
